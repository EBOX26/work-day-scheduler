# work-day-scheduler
Module 5 challenge 

This is a "work day scheduler" made as a week 5 coding challenge.
This challenge had starter code that I have added JavaScript to, using jquery, and dayjs.
When the deployed application is opened a schedule will be presented.
A user can then type events or messages into the text boxes and click the save button.
when the save button is clicked then the text entered will be saved to local storage, where it will be retreived
when the page is reloaded. Upon clicking of the save button text will also appear a the top of the page notifing the 
user that their appointment has been added. The text entry boxes are up to date with the current time and will be color coded 
according to whether or not the hour is past, present or in the future.
